How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	It could make more efficient a programmer because it could have access to previous functional and not functional versions of the code to validate or discard versions.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	automatically versions could help us to prevent big times betwwen versions and important changes, but also can contibute to unnecesarry versions without significant changes. Manually changes throught commit control a rational numbers of commint when are needed, but could let us to forget important changes that are not easealy noticed as we increment our code lines. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Better syncronization throught project

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
